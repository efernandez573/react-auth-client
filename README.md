## App Description

The idea behind this application was to create a platform for users to add content, specifically, blogposts.
Initally I wanted the application to allow user to add blogposts, audiobooks, books, videos of their favorite topic.
<br> This content would be drawn in from a 3rd party API, I quickly realized how difficult it would be to use multiple APIs in my application while also learning a new front end framework, namely React. Therefore, this is a VERY pared down version of what I had hoped to accomplish with this application. <br>In a future iteration of this application, users would be able to search for a particular topics of interest and would be able to search through multiple apis. Registered users would also be able to compile curated content in the application for other users to view.
<br>i.e. Search for Topic of Interest(Veganism)
    Books, Blogposts, Audiobooks, Videos all related to Veganism
